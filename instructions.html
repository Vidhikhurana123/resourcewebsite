              <h3>*File Preparation</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>To prepare your design for screen printing, follow these steps:</p>
        <li>Design in black and white using high-contrast graphics. Vector files (.ai, .eps, .svg) are ideal.</li>
        <li>Convert all text to outlines to avoid font issues during printing.</li>
        <li>Make sure your design is sized correctly for your screen and printing area.</li>
        <li>Use at least 300 DPI resolution if you’re designing in raster format (e.g., Photoshop).</li>
        <li>Keep designs simple for easier exposure and cleaner prints. Avoid very thin lines or intricate details.</li>
        <li>Print your final design on a transparency film using a high-quality inkjet or laser printer.</li>
        <li>Double-print or increase ink density to ensure the black areas are completely opaque.</li>
        <li>Store your transparencies flat and away from light and moisture until you're ready to expose your screen.</li>
      </ul>

              <h3>Step 1- Screen Selection and Coating</h3>
              <p>After the design file is prepared, the next step is selecting the appropriate screen mesh based on the detail and type of print. A higher mesh count is used for fine details, while a lower mesh is suitable for bold, heavy prints. The screen is then coated with a light-sensitive emulsion. This emulsion needs to be applied evenly in a dark or low-light environment to avoid premature exposure. Once coated, the screen is left to dry in a light-safe area, usually in a horizontal position.

            <div class="step">
              <h3>Step 2- Image Exposure</h3>
              <p>LOnce the emulsion-coated screen is dry, the design is printed onto a transparent film (called a film positive) and placed over the screen. The screen and film are then exposed to a strong light source in an exposure unit. The light hardens the emulsion where it isn’t blocked by the design. The areas covered by the design remain soft, creating a stencil. Timing during this step is crucial—overexposure or underexposure can ruin the stencil.</p>

            <div class="step">
              <h3>Step 3- Washing out the stencil</h3>
              <p>After exposure, the screen is rinsed with water, typically using a pressure washer or spray hose. The water washes away the unexposed, soft emulsion where the design was, while the hardened emulsion remains. This creates the open areas of the stencil through which ink will pass during printing. Once the image is fully washed out and clear, the screen is left to dry thoroughly before printing begins.</p>
